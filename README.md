# leaflet-challenge

I found this challenge very enjoyable because it was visually satisfying see how I can change the map.
Initially it was difficult to wrap my head around how I was going to read in the data into javascript. 
However it became a lot more clear when I took a step back and worked on other parts first, such as setting up the bare bones of the base map and overlay map.
It allowed me to work backwards and figure out how everything connected instead of being stuck at the start.
